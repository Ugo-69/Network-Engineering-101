# Network-Engineering-101
A collection of hands-on Cisco Packet Tracer projects covering core network engineering concepts like VLANs, routing, ACLs, NAT, DHCP, and more. Built to practice and demonstrate real-world networking skills through simulation.


ðŸ”§ What Youâ€™ll Find:

Basic to advanced network topologies
VLANs and trunking setups
Static and dynamic routing (RIP, EIGRP, OSPF)
Access Control Lists (ACLs)
NAT, DHCP, and DNS configurations
Simple firewall/security implementations
Troubleshooting simulations

ðŸŽ¯ Goal:
To apply core network engineering concepts through simulations and help others understand how networks work in practice.
Whether you're a student, beginner, or someone brushing up on fundamentals, this repo offers a solid starting point to learn and experiment.
