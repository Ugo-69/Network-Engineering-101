This configuration sets up a basic school network with VLAN segmentation and DHCP

Below is a sample configuration file for a Cisco Packet Tracer project that sets up a basic school network.
The network includes a router, a switch, and multiple PCs to simulate a small school LAN.
The configuration includes VLANs for different departments (e.g., Staff and Students), DHCP for IP address assignment, and basic routing.
The file is a text-based configuration that can be imported into Cisco Packet Tracer or used as a reference to configure devices.
